# Analysis of Tweets about Web Summit 2022
First of all, I would like to warn you that I did not attend the Web Summit 2022, which took place during November 1-4, 2022 in Lisbon as has been the case in recent years. Thus, I decided to collect tweets posted related to the event between October 31st and November 4th because I believe that one day before people start posting about the event they are going to attend, in this case the Web Summit, as the participants may be going to the event itself.
